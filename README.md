# AI-Powered Meal Planning System

This repository contains the codebase for an AI-driven meal planning application that generates customized meal plans, accommodates dietary restrictions, and provides nutritional recommendations.

---

## Features

- **Custom Meal Plans**: Generate personalized meal plans for 2-4 meals per day based on user data such as age, weight, height, and activity level.
- **Allergy and Dietary Filtering**: Excludes meals based on allergies (e.g., nuts, lactose, gluten) and dietary choices (e.g., vegan).
- **Food Recommendations**: Suggests alternative food items using K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN).
- **Nutritional Optimization**: Provides plans tailored to specific dietary needs (e.g., high-protein, low-carb, balanced).

---

## Technology Stack

- **Backend**: Python, Flask
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, Bootstrap
- **Machine Learning**:
  - KNN for food similarity analysis.
  - XGBoost for calorie and meal frequency predictions.
- **Data**:
  - `Cleaned_Data_Final.csv`: Nutritional dataset for various food items.
  - `All_Diets.csv`: Pre-defined dietary categories.
